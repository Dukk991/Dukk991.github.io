            <h2> <em>Who I am?</em> </h2>
            <pre class = "body2"> I am a 20 year old male from Oulu Finland.
 I was born and raised in Kemi Finland. In ladder have of 2023.
 I moved in Oulu to study information technology. Currently I am specializing in software development.

 I completed my matriculation examination in june of 2022.
 July of the same year I entered in to the army. I went to the laplands jaeger battalion.
 In total I spent 347 days in the army. 9 months in Sodankylä and 3 in Hamina.
 My current military rank in 2nd ltn.

In my free time I spent on my computer, in the gym or with my girlfriend or friends.
I have no coding experience prior to 2023. I wasn't even planning on studying software engineering.
I wanted to stay in the military but I didn't get hired. Probably better that way :P
